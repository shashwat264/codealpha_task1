How It Works
The program uses the rand() function to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess:
If the guess is too low, the program outputs "Too low! Try again."
If the guess is too high, it outputs "Too high! Try again."
If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the player and exits the loop.
The program also keeps track of the number of attempts.
